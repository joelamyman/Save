# romanhairstyles
Submission for the UX UK Awards

Included in this folder is the Processing 2.2.1 source code for the Roman Hairstyles program that I've created. In order for this to work, the OpenCV for Processing libraries must be installed.

The program requires a webcam to work.

OpenCV can be installed from GitHub here - https://github.com/atduskgreg/opencv-processing
Processing 2.2.1 can be installed from the Processing site here - https://processing.org/download/

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Within the RomanHairstyle folder is the source code, as well as all of the assets needed to properly run the program.

If you're having issues with getting the program to run, I suggest placing the file in the OpenCV examples folder and running from there.

Camera shots are saved to the file with the date and current time as their name.
